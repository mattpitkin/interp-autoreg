This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of Gibbs sampling
to performing interpolation of missing data described by an autoregressive model. This is based
on Chapter 6 of [_Numerical Bayesian Methods Applied to Signal Processing_](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-0717-7) by J. Ã“ Ruanaidh & W. Fitzgerald.

The notebook can be run in a conda environment generated using the provided [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) file. E.g.,
Create and activate the environment with:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate interp-autoreg
```

then set up the [extension to enable equation numbering](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42940005/1862861) (just do this once):

```bash
jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
jupyter nbextension enable equation-numbering/main
```

and open the notebook with:

```bash
jupyter notebook interp-autoreg.ipynb &
```
